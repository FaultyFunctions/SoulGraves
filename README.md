A unique graves plugin where players collect their souls to retrieve their belongings when they die. A soul will spawn at your death location that provides audio and visual feedback for your death location. Once you find it you can retrieve your items by walking into your soul. Be careful though, wait too long and your soul wil burst dropping all your items!

## Features
- Additional Minecraft death mechanics
- Fun particle effects
- Soul persists through restarts
- Five minutes to collect your soul before vanilla death mechnics take over
- Visual cue to indicate when the soul is about to burst
- Audible heartbeat to make finding your soul easier
- Collecting your own soul will provide more XP (50%) vs someone else collecting it or letting it expire (20%)
- Soul Graves will avoid spawning a soul in liquids, the void, and non-solid blocks
- Multiple souls possible at the same time
