A unique graves plugin where players collect their souls to retrieve their belongings when they die. A soul will spawn at your death location that provides audio and visual feedback to help you locate it. Once you find it you can retrieve your items by walking into your soul. Be careful though, wait too long and your soul will burst dropping all your items!

## Features
- Additional Minecraft death mechanics
- Fun particle effects
- Soul persists through restarts
- Visual cue to indicate when the soul is about to burst
- Audible heartbeat to make finding your soul easier
- Soul Graves will avoid spawning a soul in liquids, the void, and non-solid blocks
- Players can have multiple souls possible at the same time
- Option to only let owners retrieve their souls
- Option to make it so souls destroy items or XP when they burst
- Customizable XP return percentages
- Customizable messages
- Minimessage support
